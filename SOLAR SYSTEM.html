            <p>The Solar System includes the Sun and all the objects that orbit around it, such as planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects. There are eight planets in our solar system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mercury</li>
                <li>Venus</li>
                <li>Earth</li>
                <li>Mars</li>

                <li>Uranus</li>
                <li>Neptune</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each planet has its own unique characteristics and features.</p>

                                <p>Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun in our solar system. It is also the smallest planet, with a diameter of just 4,879 km. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere that consists mostly of helium and some trace amounts of other gases.</p>
                                <p>Mercury is named after the Roman messenger god, because it orbits the sun so quickly that it appears to move faster than any other planet in the sky.</p>

                                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the sixth largest planet in our Solar System with a mass and diameter similar to Earth’s. It is known as the 'Morning Star' or 'Evening Star' because it is often the brightest object in the sky just after sunset or just before sunrise. Venus is also known as Earth's 'sister planet' due to its size, mass, and composition. However, it has a vastly different climate and atmosphere.</p>

                                <p>Venus has a thick and toxic atmosphere consisting mostly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid. These clouds completely cover the planet and create a greenhouse effect, trapping heat and making Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System with an average surface temperature of 462°C. Venus' atmosphere is so dense that it exerts a pressure on the surface more than 90 times greater than Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level.</p>

However, it has a much thinner atmosphere and colder temperatures.</p>
                                <p>Mars has the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris. It is also home to the highest peak in the Solar System, and significant amounts of water ice have been discovered on the planet.</p>

Jupiter has no solid surface and is primarily made up of hydrogen, helium, and other gases.</p>
                                <p>Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field, and it is home to the largest number of moons in the Solar System, with 79 discovered so far. The four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons, are named after Galileo Galilei, who discovered them in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</p>

The planet is named after the Roman god of agriculture and wealth. Saturn is a gas giant and has a diameter of about 72,367 miles (116,460 kilometers) - about nine times the diameter of Earth. Saturn is the second-largest planet in the Solar System, after Jupiter.</p>
                                <p>Saturn has more than 80 moons, the largest of which is Titan. Titan is unique in that it has a thick atmosphere, with a weather cycle similar to Earth's. Its atmosphere is primarily made up of nitrogen, which is important for the production of organic compounds. </p>

                                <p>The atmosphere of Saturn is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other gases. The planet has strong winds that can reach up to 1,100 miles per hour (1,800 kilometers per hour). The Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, discovered a hexagonal-shaped storm at the planet's north pole. The storm is a unique feature of Saturn's atmosphere and is about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) wide.</p>

                                <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for being the first planet to be discovered through the use of a telescope. The planet is named after the Greek god of the sky. Uranus is an ice giant planet and has a diameter of about 31,518 miles (50,724 kilometers). It is much larger than the four gas giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). </p>
                                <p>Uranus has a unique tilt, which is almost 98 degrees. This means that its axis of rotation is almost parallel to its orbital plane around the Sun. As a result, Uranus has extreme seasons that last for many years. </p>

                                <p>The atmosphere of Uranus is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane. It has a distinctive blue-green color due to the methane in its atmosphere. Uranus has strong winds that can reach around 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour). As Uranus is tilted on its side, its poles receive more energy from the Sun than its equatorial regions, causing the formation of strong storms and unusual weather patterns.</p>

                                <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our Solar System. It is named after the Roman god of the sea. Neptune is a gas giant and has a diameter of about 30,599 miles (49,244 kilometers). It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System. </p>
                                <p>Neptune has 14 known moons, including the largest, Triton, which was discovered just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered in 1846. Triton is one of the coldest objects in the Solar System. </p>
